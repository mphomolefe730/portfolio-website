			"Write C++ code for a program that reads in an unknown num- ber of “Reverse 2048” games. The program must then use an algorithm to solve each of the solvable puzzles given in the input file", 
			"Reverse 2048 is a variation of the classic 2048 puzzle game, a sliding tile game that is played on a 4×4 grid. Unlike the original game, where the goal is to merge tiles to reach 2048, in Reverse 2048, the player must divide tiles to reach the smallest possible value, typically tile 2. The game is played using numerical tiles, each having values that are powers of 2. The main rules of the game are:", 
			"1) Players slide tiles in four possible directions (up, down, left, right).",
			"2) When two tiles of the same value collide, they merge into one tile with half the value.",
			"3) The game ends when there are no more valid moves or when the smallest achievable value has been reached."

				"date": "Initial Board Setup",
				"description": "The board consists of a 4×4 grid initially filled with 2 tiles having a value of 2048. New tiles appear after each move, following a random pattern. The new tiles have large numerical values of either 2048 or 1024 (no tile value lower than this should appear on the grid)"

For example, Two 2048s combine into a 1024, Two 1024s combine into a 512, and so on, all down to two 4s combine into a 2. A move is valid only if at least one tile can be merged or moved."

The two algorithms will play against each other on separate boards at the same time. The game will start at the same spot on the both boards. The first algorithm to complete the game will be considered the winner. A maximum of 1000 moves per game per algorithm is allowed. If this limit is exceeded, the game ends as unsolved."

As an NDA was signed I can not mention everything but here are a few im allowed to share - some pages in the application were mixing with each other or not closing at all, we needed to implement a new way of managing state and use tags associated with the library of the framework as it was not done before.
